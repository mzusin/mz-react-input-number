- It allows setting **minimum** and **maximum** values for numeric inputs, as well as the increment or decrement value for numeric inputs with a **step** value.
- It allows configuring the **number of decimal places** to be displayed for numeric inputs, such as currency or percentage fields.
- It supports **arrow up**, **arrow down**, **enter**, **escape** events. Arrow up and down events can be used to increment or decrement the numeric value, enter can be used to validate the input, and escape can be used to cancel the input.
- **Mousewheel support**: It allows using the mouse wheel to increment or decrement the numeric value.
- It supports **Home**, **End**, **PageUp**, and **PageDown** events. Home and PageUp allows jumping to the start of the input field, while End and PageDown allows jumping to the end of the input field. 
- It allows customizing the appearance of the input field by passing custom **CSS classes** and **styles**.
- It allows using all standard HTML input attributes like disabled, autocomplete, etc., to customize the behavior of the input field.
- Remove regex
- Optionally, it allows removing non-numeric characters from the input field using regular expressions, ensuring that the input only contains valid numeric characters.
